## About Me!
Hi, my name is Madison Nguyen, and I’m a third-year Electrical Engineering student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I have 2–3 years of hands-on lab experience and currently work as a shop technician in the College of Architectural Engineering and Design, where I help students bring their design and fabrication projects to life. I’m especially excited to apply my skills in prototyping, hardware/software development, and creative problem-solving. Outside of engineering, I enjoy music (I play three instruments and sing), staying active through sports like tennis, volleyball, and skiing, and exploring creative outlets such as crocheting, sewing, embroidery, and pottery.
